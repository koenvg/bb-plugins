# Code Cleanup

Code Cleanup adds project guidance controls to BB Settings. Its factory prompt asks agents to record substantial adjacent cleanup as separate BB Tasks only for observed defects or concrete maintenance costs. Each finding must state current evidence and expected benefit. For maintenance work, it must name the current change that is difficult and how cleanup makes it easier. No cleanup findings is a valid result. Agents continue their assigned work. The plugin does not inspect code or create tasks itself.

## Use Settings

With the plugin enabled and running, open Settings and select Code Cleanup in the plugin sidebar. In Project guidance, the read-only overview lists all standard projects by name. Viewing it writes nothing. It shows five columns: Project, Enabled, Setting source, Prompt, and Actions. Values are saved settings, not unsaved prompt drafts. Click a project name or **Edit prompt** to open its prompt dialog. The table remains visible but inactive while the dialog is open.

The host field **Enable for projects without an override** comes first and starts Off on fresh install and upgrade. It applies to unconfigured standard projects, including future projects. It does not turn the BB plugin on or off and does not change explicit project choices.

The project switch shows effective On/Off. Changing it saves an explicit choice. The Setting source column identifies Default or Project override. **Use default** removes only the enablement choice and keeps custom prompt text and any draft. It is unavailable when the project already follows the default. Explicit On and Off choices take precedence when the default changes.

Each overview row has a project-specific switch. Its icon-only check or cross shows On or Off. The restore icon is Use default. Hover or focus shows the current state or action in a tooltip. All controls keep project-specific accessible names and the switch keeps its On/Off state for assistive technology. A short icon transition follows confirmed state changes; reduced-motion mode removes movement. The switch saves an explicit On or Off choice only after the server confirms the write. **Use default** appears only for an override and removes only that enablement override. The Setting source column is marked Enablement only. It does not control prompt text. The source labels are **Default** or **Project override** for enablement and **Custom** or **Plugin default** for saved prompt text. An Off project can still have Custom guidance.

One overview write can run at a time. The pending row shows saving feedback; row controls and editor selection are blocked until it finishes. Failed writes retain confirmed values and name the project. Use the same control to retry manually. Notifications and reconnect refresh saved summaries without replacing unsaved prompt drafts. Initial read failure shows unknown settings, not Off switches. A refresh failure keeps rows labelled as last saved and blocks row writes until **Retry overview** succeeds. Requests are not retried automatically.

Click a project name or its **Edit prompt** action to open one fixed-project native dialog. There is no project selector or inline editor. Opening is read-only, including when the project is Off. The dialog shows the project title, saved prompt source, exact draft, character count, Edit/Preview, a named close control and Reset/Cancel/Save. Edit and Preview keep their named icons and hover/focus labels. Use Left/Right, Home and End to change tabs. Preview uses the public BB Markdown component where supported, with a source-only fallback on older hosts.

Save is unavailable for an unchanged draft, a pending write or a prompt conflict. It accepts nonblank text up to 4,096 JavaScript string characters and preserves exact spaces, newlines and literal shell characters. Confirmed Save updates the saved table source and closes the dialog. Failed or conflicting writes keep it open with the draft. Save and Reset do not change enablement or other projects.

Cancel, close and Escape close a clean dialog without writes. A dirty draft gets a confirmation inside the same dialog. **Keep editing** preserves it; **Discard changes** closes without saving. Escape from confirmation returns to editing. Backdrop clicks do not dismiss. Pending persistence blocks edits, dismissals and duplicate writes. Focus starts on the safe confirmation action, returns to its initiating editor control, and returns to the opening row control on close, or the overview heading if that control no longer exists.

**Reset to plugin default** asks for confirmation and explains that it saves immediately. Confirmed Reset removes custom text atomically, shows factory guidance, updates the saved row source and keeps the dialog open. Later Cancel does not undo this saved reset. Failed or conflicting Reset keeps the prior draft. Unsaved drafts do not survive an app reload.

The short session note applies to newly constructed agent sessions only. Existing provider sessions keep their earlier guidance. The help icon discloses the BB Tasks CLI and single linked tracker requirement. Settings does not create tasks, trackers, or workers.

## Factory behavior and upgrade preservation

Prompt Reset restores task-recording guidance, rather than the former reporting-only policy. Upgrade preserves every saved custom prompt exactly. Existing enabled and disabled rows become explicit choices, including disabled rows created by saving a prompt in an older version. The new global default remains false. Only an explicit Save or confirmed prompt Reset changes project text.

The SQLite migration adds a nullable `enabled_override` column and copies each legacy `enabled` value once. It appends to the shipped migration list. Reload does not repeat the copy or pin newly inherited rows. Missing rows and new prompt-only rows follow the saved default. Saving or resetting a prompt never creates an enablement choice. Enable/disable writes both the legacy column and the override; Use default clears only the override.

The factory guidance directs agents to find one tracker linked to the BB project, search all open-task pages, reuse matches, and record actionable follow-ups with source task/thread context. Labels must exist, and required blockers need verified task keys. If a new cleanup ticket needs the current change merged first, the agent must save the new ticket as blocked by the current ticket. It must never make the current ticket wait for that cleanup. Independent cleanup does not need this dependency. Missing keys or failed dependency writes mean incomplete recording; the agent reports any confirmed cleanup key and the error without claiming success. Missing or ambiguous trackers, unavailable CLI, and failed search/create writes also produce an honest report. This default-prompt update does not rewrite custom prompts. Existing sessions keep their prior instructions. The agent records only; it does not perform unrelated cleanup, dispatch workers, notify threads, or change the current task's status.

Default changes update fresh eligible agent configuration without plugin reload. CLI, RPC, and agent configuration share one enablement resolver and saved Settings default.

## Concurrent edits and recovery

Open Settings views refresh after confirmed CLI or UI changes and after reconnect. The overview refreshes independently. Project notifications refresh the open dialog only for its fixed project. Clean editors adopt the current saved prompt and enablement source. Dirty editors keep their exact draft and original saved-prompt precondition. A saved-state-change notice appears when the saved values differ. Enablement can refresh without replacing prompt text.

Settings Save and Reset send `expectedPrompt`, the exact nullable saved text loaded by the editor. Storage compares and writes inside one immediate SQLite transaction. A stale precondition returns `{ status: "conflict", state }` without changing the newer prompt or enablement. Success returns `{ status: "saved", state }`. Reset keeps the prompt baseline, draft and precondition from when its confirmation opened, even if a notification arrives before confirmation. These are prompt-text checks, not revision checks. A value changed away and then back to identical text is still a match.

On conflict, the page keeps the draft and disables Save and Reset. It does not retry with a new precondition. Copy the draft if you need it, select **Reload saved settings**, then choose **Discard and reload** or **Cancel**. Only a successful confirmed Reload replaces the draft and clears the conflict. A failed Reload keeps the draft. **Retry project** repeats a safe refresh, not a discard or a Save. If a Save response fails, you can retry Save with the original precondition; if the first write did persist, the retry reports a conflict. Reload confirms the actual saved state.

Notifications are best effort. A failed notification cannot make a confirmed saved write fail. If changes were missed, reconnect or use Reload saved settings. An offline notice identifies when automatic updates are unavailable. Reads ignore older request generations and responses for other projects. Local writes block overlapping writes and dialog dismissal until the request ends.

CLI `prompt set` and `prompt reset` remain deliberate unconditional replacements. They notify open views but do not use an editor precondition. Do not run an unattended all-project CLI reset while another client can edit prompts. Any approved bulk reset is a separate, scoped operation, not an upgrade migration.

## Test the isolated Settings preview

Run `npm ci`, then `npm run preview:settings` from this package. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4888/`. Set `PORT` to use another port.

The preview renders the actual app entry with a small public app runtime adapter. Requests use official fake-host RPC, the host Settings write driver, and temporary real SQLite, not production storage. Its default control renders the actual backend descriptor but is not BB's native host form. Alpha starts explicitly On with multiline custom text. Beta starts inherited Off with the factory prompt. Delta starts explicitly Off with the factory prompt. Gamma has a long name and starts explicitly Off with custom text. Personal projects are excluded. Fixture links cover empty, load-failure, refresh-failure, save-failure, and slow-request states. Refresh failure starts with readable summaries. Change the fixture default to make subsequent summary reads fail. Recover fixture requests clears failure mode without reloading the app or losing drafts; then use Retry overview or repeat the failed row action. Click a project name or Edit prompt to inspect the native dialog. Use two preview tabs to try dirty-draft conflicts and discard-before-reload. Two preview tabs share the same temporary state. A fixture-only event poll delivers confirmed changes to both tabs. This poll is not part of the installed plugin. Restarting resets fixture values.

The fixture uses a development-only Markdown substitute. It skips raw HTML and image requests; tests check literal code, unsafe links, and HTML. This substitute and the official frontend harness do not prove BB's production Markdown parser. Live checks cover native Settings discovery, rendering, theme, and reload behavior separately. Before live deployment, preserve private state/source/build snapshots, take a supported database backup, and prepare rollback. Never publish raw prompt backups.

## CLI

From this directory, run `bb plugin build` and `bb plugin install . --yes` for a fresh installation. On a live installation, follow the backup and deployment steps below first. BB enables plugins globally; Code Cleanup's separate default starts false. Use a standard project ID from `bb project list`:

```sh
bb code-cleanup enable --project proj_ID
bb code-cleanup show --project proj_ID
bb code-cleanup disable --project proj_ID
bb code-cleanup enablement reset --project proj_ID
bb code-cleanup prompt set --project proj_ID --text 'Project-specific instructions'
bb code-cleanup prompt reset --project proj_ID
```

`show` reports effective enabled/disabled, custom/default prompt source, and `enablement: default` or `enablement: project override`. Disable keeps custom text. `enablement reset` returns only enablement to the saved default. `prompt reset` changes only prompt text. For multiline input, pass the exact source as one `--text` argument. A single-quoted shell argument can contain newlines; if source contains single quotes, use an argument-array process API instead of shell interpolation. There is no supported `--text-stdin` flag.

To change the default through the public host configuration command:

```sh
bb plugin config code-cleanup set enableByDefault true
bb plugin config code-cleanup set enableByDefault false
```

Enabling this default is a separate user choice. Upgrade must leave it false. All explicit enabled and disabled project choices stay unchanged.

Settings survive reload and global disable/re-enable. Personal, projectless, and side-chat contexts receive no contribution. `bb plugin disable code-cleanup` unloads the plugin globally and affects fresh sessions. Re-enable it before using its CLI again.

## Deployment and rollback

1. Obtain separate deployment approval. Before installing or reloading the new build, record the installed path/hash and snapshot every stored project choice and exact prompt, plus the host default setting. Preserve the prior source and `dist` privately. For the current live installation, the snapshot must cover all 12 enabled/custom rows.
2. Take a fresh, consistent SQLite backup through SQLite's backup API or the supported host backup mechanism. Do not copy an active WAL database file alone. Keep prompt backups private and verify the backup is readable before proceeding.
3. Build and validate in a private package copy when the live installation uses this worktree. Only replace the live build and reload after approval and the final backup. Leave `enableByDefault` false. Compare every saved choice and exact prompt with the snapshot, then check Settings, CLI, and fresh eligible session resolution.
4. For rollback, stop the plugin, restore the prior source/build, and restore the pre-upgrade database and host setting snapshot when needed. The retained legacy `enabled` column is not a complete rollback. The old build cannot represent inherited enablement or the new default. Restoring the backup discards configuration edits made after upgrade; warn the user before doing that. Restore only Code Cleanup state, not unrelated plugin data.

The [command reference](skills/code-cleanup/SKILL.md) is not auto-imported into agent sessions. `bb.skills: []` keeps the dynamic guidance contribution in one place.
