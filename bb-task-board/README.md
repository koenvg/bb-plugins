# Tasks for BB

A local task board inside BB. Tasks belong to BB projects, persist in the plugin's own SQLite database, and can start or link to BB threads. No OpenForge service or account is required.

## Use it

Install from this directory:

```sh
bb plugin build
bb plugin install . --yes
```

Open **Tasks** in the BB sidebar. Pick a project and fill in a prompt to create a task; priority defaults to normal. Edit the prompt, priority, status, attention flag, labels, prerequisites and linked thread in the detail pane. The board shows an excerpt of each prompt and has Focus, In flight, Out of focus, Backlog and Done views. Focus and Out of focus are manual flags on in-progress tasks; In flight includes both. Each view and search query filters the entire project before paging 200 results at a time. Existing prerequisites can be removed even when they are not on the current page; add a new one by copying its full ID from its task details.

An unlinked, unfinished task with completed prerequisites offers **Start**. It opens BB's new-thread composer with the task prompt and project filled in. Review or edit the prompt and choose the model, environment, and permissions before sending. The thread must stay in the task's project. Submitting links the thread and moves the task to In progress with Focus attention; leaving without submitting does nothing. A linked task offers **Open thread** instead. Starting work does not mark a task Done when the agent finishes.

If BB creates a thread but saving its task link is interrupted—or BB's reply is uncertain—the task shows a pending launch instead of starting another agent. The task detail offers **Review launch**. Its page updates when another tab completes the link, and **Recheck** searches again for the claimed thread. While creation is active, wait; manual recovery is unavailable.

If the claim remains unresolved, enter the ID of a known existing thread in the same project and choose **Link thread**. Or, after checking that no thread was created, choose **Release claim** and confirm the warning. The server searches once more before either action, so a newly discovered task-originated thread is linked instead. If BB cannot finish that search, the claim stays pending.

Releasing neither deletes a thread nor starts a new one; it leaves the task unchanged. A delayed thread could still appear, so releasing may allow duplicate work if you later submit a new composer. Starting again always takes a separate submission. Manual links in task details and manual status changes remain available when no launch is pending.

Agents and scripts can use the same store:

```sh
bb task-board list --project proj_example
bb task-board add --project proj_example --prompt "Write the docs" --priority high
bb task-board update TASK-id --patch '{"status":"doing","focus":"focus","labels":["docs"]}'
bb task-board update TASK-id --patch '{"threadId":"thr_example","dependsOn":["TASK-other"]}'
bb task-board update TASK-id --patch '{"status":"done"}'
```

CLI responses are JSON. `bb task-board list` supports `--view`, `--query`, `--limit` (1–500) and `--offset`; the result includes filtered `total` and project-wide view counts. `bb task-board show <task-id>` returns one complete task. The detail pane checks `updatedAt` when saving: if another writer changed the task, it keeps your draft and offers an explicit reload instead of overwriting the new version. Scripts may pass `expectedUpdatedAt` in an update patch for the same check. `bb task-board help` shows command usage. The included `project-tasks` skill explains this workflow to BB agents.

Upgrading an existing install combines each task's old title and description into its prompt, with a blank line between them. Existing tasks keep their other fields.
## Boundaries

- Prerequisites must belong to the same project and form an acyclic graph. They must be done before moving a task to In progress. Deleting a prerequisite clears that link from its dependents.
- A linked thread must already exist in the same project. Linking does not create, start, or change the thread. Task status and thread status are independent.
- Task deletion does not delete a linked thread. Project deletion does not automatically delete the plugin's stored task rows; orphaned tasks are hidden when their project is gone.
- This plugin does not import OpenForge tasks or reproduce its agent runs, PR reviews or attention automation.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npx vitest run
npx tsc --noEmit
bb plugin build
bb plugin reload task-board
```

The backend is `server.ts` (SQLite, RPC, CLI, realtime); the sidebar page is `app.tsx`. The plugin uses the host's theme tokens and vendored UI controls. Test state with `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/testing` in `server.test.ts`.
