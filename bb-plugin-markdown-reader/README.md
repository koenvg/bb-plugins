# Markdown Reader

A read-only file opener for live workspace, absolute-host, and thread-storage `.md` and `.markdown` files. It uses a centered prose column, generous spacing, bounded code highlighting, and quiet tables. BB keeps its own tabs and file-opening preferences.

BBP-27 through BBP-31 implement this package. BBP-32 records assembled checks and a temporary, approved local installation followed by removal. The package is not published. Required native acceptance remains open.

## Use

After an explicit installation, select Markdown Reader with BB's one-off **Open with** choice or under **File openers**. Keep BB selected there if you prefer its built-in preview. This plugin does not change those preferences.

- Preview renders ordinary Markdown and GFM, including tables, read-only task lists, quotes, and fenced code. Native list markers remain visible under BB's reset, including ordered starts, nested lists and generated footnotes. Only task items suppress their marker; ordinary items in mixed task lists keep theirs.
- Preview hides a leading YAML frontmatter block delimited by `---`. It does not interpret the metadata. Body headings retain their original source line numbers. Ordinary separators and Setext headings remain Markdown.
- Raw shows the complete loaded text, including frontmatter, line endings, and code spaces. It is not an editor. Switching views does not read or write the file.
- Refresh reads the current file again and updates both views. There is no automatic file watching. During refresh, the reader labels retained content as not verified current. If refresh fails, it reports the failure and marks the retained snapshot stale. Retry reads the source again and clears that label only after success.
- Failed or unsupported reads offer Open in BB preview beside Retry. It renders BB's `Original` component, already bound to this file. It does not open the file again through plugin selection.

## Add selected text to chat

Select document text in Preview or Raw, then choose **Add to chat** near the selection. It appends a blockquote to this file panel's associated chat draft and focuses the composer. Existing text, mentions and uploaded attachments stay in place, even when the composer has a text selection. It never sends a message or writes the file.

Preview quotes the visible text, including table cells and highlighted code. It does not include hidden frontmatter or infer source lines. Raw quotes exactly the selected source text, not the surrounding source lines. Raw references use inclusive one-based source lines; a wrapped line remains one source line. An endpoint at the start of the next line does not include that line.

Examples of the first two quote lines:

```text
> notes/plan.md
> workspace · host local · project project-id · environment environment-id

> /srv/notes/plan.md:4-6
> host · host remote-id

> reports/plan.md:4-4
> thread-storage · host remote-id · owner thread owner-id
```

The selected excerpt follows those lines, with a `> ` prefix on every line. References use the displayed snapshot's path and resolved host. A storage-owner thread identifies the file's origin, not the destination chat. Workspace project/environment identity is included when supplied with the snapshot target. Indentation, internal blank lines and Markdown punctuation stay intact. Browser selection can normalize newlines and rendered table spacing; quote newlines use LF.

Only non-whitespace selections wholly inside the current document are eligible. Toolbar, outline, status and other-reader text do not qualify. Clearing the selection, Escape, outside activation, scrolling, switching views, Refresh, changing the file or associated composer, or leaving the reader closes the action. Select again after a successful read. Loading and stale content can still be copied normally, but cannot be added through this action.

The action requires an associated thread or new-thread draft. Other editing sessions show an unavailable action and an explanation. Rejected insertion reports a local error without automatic retry; check the associated draft and select again. A focus failure after insertion reports that the quote was added, without adding it twice.

With browser caret browsing enabled, create a selection with the keyboard, use Tab to reach **Add to chat**, then Enter or Space to activate it. Focus has a visible outline. Fine-pointer devices get the custom action; coarse-pointer devices retain the operating system's native selection controls.

## Heading and line navigation

Outline lists only headings from the rendered Markdown parse. It keeps heading levels and visible inline text, including code and link text. Repeated headings have distinct GitHub-style fragment names, such as `#section` and `#section-1`. Non-ASCII names are supported, including percent-encoded fragments. Every mounted reader has separate DOM targets. Outline entries and known fragment links scroll and focus the heading in that reader without opening the file again. Missing or malformed fragments remain inert. Footnote references and return links scroll and focus targets within the same reader. Their accessibility references stay reader-local. The parser's hidden footnote label is not a source heading and does not create an outline entry.

Above 1080 px of reader width, Outline shows a 164 px aside beside the bounded prose column. Narrower readers use a closed **On this page** disclosure. Use Outline to hide it and return space to the document. Heading-free documents have no outline or toggle. The layout measures the reader panel, not the browser window.

BB's `experimental_lineRange` uses inclusive, one-based `startLineNumber` and `endLineNumber` values. A request selects Raw, highlights real source lines, and reveals the start after loading. A new request object with the same values reveals again without a new read or model replacement. Line-only changes do not reload the source. You can still select Preview or Raw manually.

Reversed integer bounds are put in order and clamped to existing lines. Invalid, fractional, non-finite, or unsafe integer bounds do not highlight lines. Empty text has nothing to highlight. Removing the request clears its highlight, not the manual view choice. Raw wraps long lines but keeps one target per source line, including the empty line after a final newline. CRLF, frontmatter, Unicode, and code spaces stay unchanged. Navigation never writes the file.

The header shows the actual filename above quiet directory context. Its complete path remains available by title and accessible name. Preview/Raw form one compact group of named host icon buttons. All toolbar buttons have hover/focus hints that Escape dismisses. Outline keeps a visible pressed state. Desktop readers use one header row; readers at or below 600 px use two rows, with further control wrapping if needed. Keyboard users can reach the buttons with Tab and activate them with Enter or Space. Code and tables have their own scroll regions. Appearance follows the active host tokens, not a reader theme switch.

## Supported sources and limits

All supported files use the same Preview/Raw reader and read-only `read_document` RPC. The source module validates the opener target, then uses `bb.sdk.files.read` with an explicit `hostId`, absolute `path`, and confined `rootPath`. The browser cannot supply an arbitrary root or a separate filesystem command. No server-local filesystem access or document writes occur.

- Workspace files use a relative path and the supplied environment or project source. Thread-backed targets resolve the actual thread's workspace identity. Project sources select the explicit host, or the unique default source when no host is supplied.
- Absolute-host files use the explicit opener host or the host of the supplied environment. A thread-only host target resolves the thread's actual environment first. Without an explicit host or environment identity, the read fails rather than using the server host. The permitted root is the file's containing directory, not the workspace root or host filesystem root. A read-only host worker resolves that directory's real path on the selected host, so directory aliases such as macOS `/tmp` work. Document reads and local-image requests use this real directory root. File symlinks still pass through SDK confinement checks.
- Thread-storage files require the actual storage thread ID. `threads.storageLocation({ threadId })` supplies the host and storage root. The plugin does not construct a storage path from a server data directory or substitute the workspace root.

Supplied thread, project, environment, and host identities must agree with their resolved source. Missing, inconsistent, ambiguous, or unready workspace identity shows an actionable error. Missing files, access failures, and disconnected hosts offer Retry and the bound BB preview. A bare file name such as `notes.md` that fails to read at a workspace or thread-storage root opens the one file with that name below the root. Dot directories and `node_modules` are skipped. Several matches show an error that lists them. The SDK enforces root confinement, including resolved symlinks, on the selected host. A rejected read does not retry on another host.

Relative workspace/storage paths must be literal Markdown paths. Parent/dot traversal, percent encoding, backslashes, control characters, and colons are not accepted. Host paths must be absolute POSIX, Windows drive, or UNC file paths. Device paths, traversal, encoded paths, and Windows alternate data streams are rejected. Windows roots and files use Windows path semantics even when the server uses a different OS.

The reader accepts complete UTF-8 text up to **1 MiB**, including empty files. Preview reports an empty file; Raw preserves its empty source. Binary or invalid UTF-8 encoding and non-text control characters have explicit unsupported states. Larger or unsupported files offer the bound BB preview and are never returned to the reader for parsing. The current SDK has no stat or byte-limited read option. It can transfer a larger file to the server before this plugin rejects it. The 1 MiB limit bounds reader content, not SDK transfer.

## Links and images

Safe relative file links use BB's public source-aware FileLink. Siblings and literal parents inside the selected root are permitted. Host files cannot escape their containing-directory root. Unsafe schemes, malformed URLs/encodings, encoded traversal, and lexical root escapes stay readable without active href/src or content/navigation effects. Same-document heading and footnote fragments stay within the reader. Cross-file heading fragments are inert because the SDK has no heading-fragment opening location. Project-only workspaces without an environment remain readable, but native links need an environment.

Native local-file navigation uses normal BB opening behavior. It has **no extra plugin guarantee that a final symlink target stays inside the reader root**. Reader reads and local-image content requests do retain SDK root and symlink confinement on the actual source host. A confined read may be attempted before host-side asset validation rejects it. Outside-root content must not be delivered by the SDK.

External HTTP(S) links use BB's opening preferences through UrlLink. Remote images are direct browser requests with anonymous CORS and no referrer, not authenticated BB proxies. They omit cross-origin credentials and require the remote host to permit CORS. Same-origin BB image URLs are blocked from that remote path. A failed image retains readable alt/error text. No data/file/javascript/mail links are activated. Raw document HTML, MDX, scripts, and embedded widgets do not execute. Task checkboxes remain disabled. No report-specific metadata is inferred.

Local raster images support PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, BMP, and ICO. SVG, HTML, PDF, and TIFF image destinations are inert. Each local image uses an opaque URL bound to that one file, behind BB's normal frontend route access checks. It does not grant folder access and has no expiry timer. Every GET uses a read-only SDK request with the original host/root and symlink confinement. The URL hides the host/root/path and cannot be edited to select another file. Plugin reload or server restart invalidates old URLs; Refresh creates new ones. At most 128 distinct destination requests and 32 distinct images are resolved per snapshot. URLs longer than 4096 characters stay individually inert; other valid destinations still work. Encoded path separators and nested path encodings are rejected for both local and external destinations. A failed image request leaves readable alt/error text. Refresh creates fresh image URLs even when text and hash do not change. View changes reuse the existing URLs. Refresh, source switching, Original, and unmount remove stale image sources and discard late results. No folder-preview leases are allocated.

## Code presentation

Fences with an explicit supported language receive lightweight highlighting up to 20 KiB of rendered UTF-8 code, including its final newline. The byte guard runs before tokenization. Unknown or missing languages, larger fences, and tokenizer failures stay plain readable code. There is no auto-detection, JSON parsing, pretty printing, or source reconstruction. Preview preserves the Markdown parser's rendered code text; Raw always preserves the complete exact original, including CRLF.
The shared highlighter also limits passive token output to 16,384 nodes and depth 64. Exceeding either budget keeps the original code plain. Both consumers use the same guarded implementation.

| Bundled language | Accepted labels         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| JSON             | `json`                  |
| JavaScript       | `javascript`, `js`      |
| TypeScript       | `typescript`, `ts`      |
| Shell            | `bash`, `sh`, `shell`   |
| Python           | `python`, `py`          |
| Markup           | `markup`, `html`, `xml` |
| CSS              | `css`                   |

Labels are case-insensitive. JSX, TSX, JSON5, and other unlisted labels remain plain. Markup-like code renders as passive text and spans, not document HTML. Inline code and unlabelled indented blocks stay plain.

The small Refractor core bundle imports only these grammars and their required shared grammar. Code uses live host UI tokens with weight, muted comments, and subdued string underlines. It does not select a separate syntax palette or promise to reproduce BB's VS Code code-theme document. The system monospace fallback yields to the host `--font-mono` token.

The toolbar, reading column, and optional outline respond to the actual reader width. Wide code and tables scroll locally. Images retain their aspect ratio. Live host token changes preserve Preview/Raw and outline state without another read or remount. Git snapshots, deleted-file previews, chat messages, diffs, and unrelated extensions stay with BB. BBP-32 separates fixture results, installed local-host evidence, and pending native checks.

## Shared document ownership

Reader and Tasks use the same private [Markdown document package](../packages/markdown-document/README.md), compiled into each plugin with the same scoped stylesheet. Neither needs the other installed or enabled. Reader still owns source authorization, host/root confinement, snapshots, Refresh, source-bound SDK links/images, selection and bound Original fallback. The shared module owns parsing and presentation, not filesystem access.

The Tasks adapter has no filesystem root and supplies deny-all in this delivery. The same relative link can therefore be active in an authorized Reader and inactive in a Tasks attachment. Matched-theme/content-width checks compare both real consumers rather than a substitute reader. See [BBP-57 validation](../verification/BBP-57/report.md) for fixture/build evidence and separate installed limits.

## Compatibility and local build

The package targets BB **>=0.46** and Plugin SDK **>=0.6.37 <0.7**, with declarations pinned to **0.6.37**. Experimental host, line-range, and Original contracts can change; recheck them with a newer BB before use.

From this package directory, use Bun 1.4.3 and Node 24.15 or newer within Node 24. Verify the shared package first, then the consumer. Package exports intentionally resolve to source, so a clean BB build can compile them without a pre-build hook.

```sh
bun install --cwd ../packages/markdown-document --frozen-lockfile
bun run --cwd ../packages/markdown-document build
bun run --cwd ../packages/markdown-document test --maxWorkers=1
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run test --maxWorkers=1
bun run typecheck
export BB_DATA_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
test "$(node_modules/.bin/bb --version)" = "0.46.0"
node_modules/.bin/bb plugin types . --check
bun run build
```

The frozen install supplies the package's own pinned official build CLI. The temporary `BB_DATA_DIR` isolates build-tool data from the desktop application. These commands build files but do not install or activate the plugin. From the repository root, `node verification/BBP-57/clean-build.mjs NEW_EVIDENCE_DIRECTORY` verifies fresh independent setup with the opposite plugin source absent.

Local installation requires operator approval. Install only this leaf package after its checks pass:

```sh
bb plugin install .
```

Before installation, record whether the reader already exists, its source/enabled state, and the opener preferences. Confirm that the receipt points to this package. Use one-off Open with for a test; do not change a persistent default opener or global theme. Do not use a Git install command for this unpublished package.

For a newly installed test reader, disable it, check BB's native fallback, then remove that exact receipt ID:

```sh
bb plugin disable <installed-id>
bb plugin remove <installed-id>
```

Keep the source directory. If a reader was already installed, restore its recorded state instead of removing it. Recheck its source before rollback and stop if another person changed it. Selecting BB under File openers is a separate, explicit preference action. This plugin registers no settings, CLI commands, content scripts, themes, or background watchers.

## Tests and browser fixture

Source tests exercise the public source-module interface with an in-memory adapter. Rendered-reader tests use Testing Library and BB's frontend harness. Server tests check the public RPC wire schema, explicit host/root reads, and public SDK imports.

`tests/source-reader.test.tsx` also joins the registered reader to the real server RPC and source module with controlled SDK responses for all three sources. It checks read-only transport, refresh, Retry, limits, and fallback without installing the plugin.

Browser tests use native TypeScript Playwright Test **1.64.0** and owned Chromium contexts. No Python or signed-in browser is needed. From this package directory:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun --bun run playwright install chromium
bun run test:browser
# Target one suite or one matrix case:
bun run test:browser navigation.spec.ts
bun run test:browser presentation.spec.ts --grep 'presentation 760-light$'
# The former UI --reproduce case:
bun run test:browser ui.spec.ts --grep '760-light$'
```

`bun run test:browser` starts this checkout's Vite fixture before Playwright loads its config. An owned Node HTTP listener binds `127.0.0.1` port `0` once. The runner receives that listener's actual bare origin and retains it during the tests. Vite uses its supported middleware API for local TSX and CSS transforms. HMR shares the same HTTP listener. There is no probe, port fallback, or server reuse. Raw `playwright test` calls fail without the runner's handoff.

Direct previews also default to port `0` and print the actual URL. Run `bun run preview:fixture`. The existing `--port 4187 --strictPort` forms still work. Binding is always strict. `MARKDOWN_READER_PREVIEW_PORT` requests a specific port for direct previews or browser tests. Direct `--port` takes precedence. Values must be integers from `0` through `65535`. Empty or malformed values fail. An occupied explicit port fails without touching the existing listener.

Each preview owns a fresh Vite cache below the runner's fresh temporary parent, or an OS temporary directory for direct use. On success, test failure, startup failure, or cancellation, the runner stops its owned POSIX process groups before removing only its parent. Direct previews close their HTTP and Vite resources before removing only their own cache. Checkout files, shared caches, and browser evidence remain. SIGKILL of the runner and host crashes cannot run cleanup.

Each test has a new browser context. Remote images are routed to synthetic PNGs. Unexpected non-local HTTP traffic is blocked and fails the test. There are no live host reads, native navigation calls, or BB installation steps.

Separate worktrees have separate default evidence paths. Concurrent runs in one checkout or with the same explicit `--output` can overwrite evidence. From the repository root, `bun scripts/verify-concurrent-browser-worktrees.mjs /tmp/bbp-196` verifies concurrent Chromium runs for all three plugins. It checks distinct origins and changed checkout markers, retains evidence, and removes its two owned verification worktrees. It reuses installed locked dependencies without browser setup or suite retries.

`bun run test` remains the primary Vitest suite. Its `tests/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` include does not collect the browser `tests/browser/*.spec.ts` files. `bun run typecheck` checks both suites.

### Coverage mapping

All six Python runners are replaced. The 42 browser cases retain their assertions and fixture inputs:

| Former runner                         | TypeScript replacement               | Cases and retained checks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Evidence and limits

Each run writes an aggregate JSON report at `test-results/results.json` and an HTML report at `playwright-report/index.html`. Each case attaches JSON results. Captures and SHA-256 identities retain all 46 original success screenshots, including the presentation top/code pairs and eight UI captures, and add the 320 px custom and 390 px light/dark coarse-pointer captures for 49 success screenshots. Presentation results include geometry, measured contrast, live contrasts, focus proof, adjacent styles, and bounded browser diagnostics. Failed tests retain a screenshot and trace in `test-results/`. Both output directories are ignored by Git and replaced by the next run. Open the report with `bun --bun run playwright show-report`.

The fixtures reuse the existing HTML/TSX pages and the same Reader and MarkdownDocument modules. Navigation uses the committed CRLF source and the `fixture-line-request` event to change public reader props only. Destination and presentation pages use the public SDK registered-app test runtime with synthetic RPC responses, navigation callbacks, image GETs, and confined GET denial. These are local fixture tests, **not installed BB acceptance**. They do not prove real host confinement, live BB routing, extension preference selection, host fonts, or native theme behavior. Default-token contrast is a controlled check, not certification of all palettes. See [token provenance and limits](tests/fixtures/theme-tokens.md).
