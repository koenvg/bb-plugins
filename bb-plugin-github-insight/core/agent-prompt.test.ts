      ## Rules

      - Address the comments in the code.
      - For each review thread, save a draft reply with \`bb github-insight review draft <thread-id> --body-file <file>\`. Say what you changed, or why you did not change the code.
      - Do not post to GitHub and do not resolve review threads. The user reads the drafts and posts them.
