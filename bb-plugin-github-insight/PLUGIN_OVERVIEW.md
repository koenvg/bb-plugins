See the checks of a thread's pull request, and the pull requests that wait for your review, without leaving bb.

- A **PR** tab in the thread's right panel.
- The PR number, title, state, `head → base` branch, lines added and removed, changed files, author, and a link to GitHub.
- One summary line at the top: the first merge blocker with "+N more", "Ready to merge", the merge queue state, or "Auto-merge on".
- Merge blockers, most important first, when there are 2 or more: conflicts, failed checks, changes requested, branch out of date, review required, unresolved threads, running checks, draft, blocked.
- Reviewers with their state, "(team)" for teams, and a "code owner" label. An open review request shows as pending, also after an earlier review.
- Every check on the head commit, one entry per check name, grouped by status. Passed and skipped checks share one collapsed line. Required checks have a "required" label.
- Failed and cancelled checks show why: a reason and up to 5 failure annotations.
- A banner above the composer shows Draft, Open, Closed, or the merged outcome, independently of blockers or available actions. Draft stays beside failed checks or conflicts. Queue state and position match the PR tab. Only an eligible Open PR has a merge or enqueue button. Clicking status opens the PR tab without a write.
- "Update branch" when the branch is behind its base. It merges the base in at once. "Update with rebase…" asks first, and is off while the thread's worktree has unpushed commits. After an update, a note says to pull before the next push.
- "Enable auto-merge (method)" when only running checks or a missing review block the merge. When auto-merge is on, the summary line says so, with "Disable".
- Updates by itself every 60 seconds while the PR is open. A refresh button updates it at once. The tab always shows "Updated <age>".
- Shows the last known PR at once when you return to a thread or restart bb, then updates it in the background.
- Errors show as "gh not installed", "gh not logged in", or "rate limited", with a retry button. Both the PR tab and composer show initial loading, read failures, and Retry. A failed refresh keeps visibly stale last-good data with its time. Confirmed no-PR hides normal banner status.

- A **Review** tab with the diff of each changed file at the PR head. Files without a patch show "Diff not available". Review threads show below their line, with all comments. Outdated threads show in an "Outdated" section at the top. Resolved threads show collapsed with "Show resolved". The top shows "N open" and "N outdated". A draft reply from the agent fills the thread's reply box as "Draft from agent". The user can edit it, post it, post and resolve it, or discard it.
- In the Review tab, the "+" in the diff gutter adds a pending comment on a line. Pending comments from the user and the agent stay after a restart and go to GitHub as one review on "Submit review". Empty pending comments are not sent.
- `bb github-insight review list` and `review draft` let the thread's agent read the open review threads and save draft replies. Drafts are never posted to GitHub by the agent.

- A **Pull Requests** nav panel with one PR list in two sections: "Needs review" and "Reviewed" (collapsed). It holds the open PRs that wait for your review, the PRs you marked reviewed, and the PRs with a review thread. PRs are grouped by repo, and PRs whose thread needs you come first. Each card shows the number, title, author, time since the last update, draft, CI state, review decision, and "Open on GitHub".
- "Start review" opens the new-thread composer with the matching bb project, a new worktree, and a review prompt. The agent checks out the PR and reviews it, but does not post to GitHub. Choices that other threads can share, like the project checkout, show "Review threads need a new worktree". When a thread already shows the PR, the card shows the thread status button, which opens the thread.
- The lists refresh in the background every 5 minutes, also while the panel is closed. The panel opens at once with the last result, also after a bb restart, and shows when it was updated. Refresh updates it at once.
- "Mark reviewed" keeps a PR in "Reviewed" until its author pushes a new commit, someone else comments or replies, or your review is requested again. Then it comes back to "Needs review" as "New commits", "New comments", or "Review requested again". Bots and approvals with no text do not count. Submitting a review from the Review tab marks the PR reviewed too.
- The Pull Requests sidebar row shows the "Needs review" count. The count becomes a pill when a new PR comes in, until you open the panel. A dot shows when a review agent came back (finished, failed, or waiting for you) and you have not opened its thread yet. Its card shows "Ready", "Needs you", or "Failed" and moves to the top.
- Review threads are hidden from the sidebar thread list. The card of the PR shows the thread status button and "Archive thread", also after the PR has left the review requests. Without the plugin, `bb thread list --include-hidden` finds them.

- **Command palette** commands: "GitHub: Merge PR", "Open PR tab", "Open Review tab", "Submit review", "Refresh PR", and "Open PR on GitHub". They show only for a thread with a PR, and "Merge PR" only when the PR can merge or enqueue. Merge uses loaded PR data and opens confirmation immediately, or waits for a load already in progress. It shows progress and errors in chat without changing the side panel. The PR tab and chat share merge progress and prevent duplicate writes. Other commands keep their existing tab behavior.

The plugin uses the `gh` CLI login of the host that runs the thread. The Pull Requests panel uses the `gh` login of bb's primary host. It needs no token of its own.
